    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Cheesecake with an Oreo crust and ganache topping. Perfect for the Holidays!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray
        <li>3 (8-oz.) blocks cream cheese, softened
        <li>1 c. granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 c. sour cream</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp. peppermint extract</li>
        <li>1 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 c. chopped chocolate, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1/2 c. chopped white chocolate, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1/2 c. chopped candy canes, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>24 Peppermint Oreos</li>
        <li>5 tbsp. melted butter</li>
        <li>3/4 c. hot heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 1/2 c. semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 350ยบ and spray an 8" springform pan with cooking spray. Make filling: In a large bowl using a hand mixer (or in a stand mixer using the paddle attachment), beat cream cheese and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, then sour cream, flour, peppermint extract, vanilla, and salt. Gently fold in chopped chocolates and candy canes and set aside.</li>
          <li>Make crust: In a food processor or in a large Ziploc bag, crush Oreos into fine crumbs. Stir with melted butter until completely moist.</li>
          <li>Add crust to prepared pan and pack tightly.</li>
          <li>Pour over filling and place pan on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until center is only slightly jiggly, about 1 hour. (If you want to use a water bath to ensure no cracking, wrap springform pan in foil and place springform pan in a deep-sided roasting pan. Pour boiling water into roasting pan until it reaches halfway up the springform pan.)</li>
          <li>Turn off oven and let cheesecake cool in oven 1 hour (this step is optional but prevents cracking).</li>
          <li>Refrigerate cheesecake until completely chilled, at least 4 hours but preferably overnight</li>
          <li>Before serving, make chocolate ganache: Pour hot cream over chocolate chips and let sit, 5 minutes. Stir until all chocolate is melted. (If ganache seems too thin, refrigerate 5 minutes.)</li>
          <li>Spread ganache over chilled cheesecake and garnish with more chopped chocolate and candy canes.</li>
          <li>Refrigerate 10 minutes before serving to let ganache harden.</li>
        </ol>

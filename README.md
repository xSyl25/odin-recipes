Finished my first project from The Odin Project!

I did a bit of FCC before this so I just applied what I learned over the course of these last 2 weeks here, but it was still a lot of fun and it helped me refresh my memory on some things I didn't remember too well. 

I look forward to improving my skills as I go through this journey, so...future me, don't give up! :D
